Feature: Search Investment Plan on PIMCO Website

  As an investor
  I want to search for investment plans on the PIMCO website
  So that I can get details and summaries of different investment options

  Background: 
    Given the user is on the PIMCO Global Homepage

  Scenario: Search and retrieve a summary of an investment plan
    When the user enters "investment Plan" into the Search by Keyword field
    And the user clicks the search button
    Then the search results page with various investment Plans is displayed
    When the user clicks on the first listed investment fund
    Then the detail page of the investment fund is displayed
    And the user can view a summary of the investment plan
