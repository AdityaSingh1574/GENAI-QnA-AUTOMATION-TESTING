  As a weather enthusiast
  I want to type a location into AccuWeather and select from search results
  So that I can view the current weather conditions for that location

  Background:

  Scenario: View current weather after typing and selecting a location
    When the user types "New Delhi" into the location input field
    And the user views the selection page with search results
