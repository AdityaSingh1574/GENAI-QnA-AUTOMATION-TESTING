Feature: SIP Calculator on Groww
  As an investor
  I want to use the SIP calculator on Groww
  So that I can estimate the future value of my investments based on my monthly contributions, investment tenure, and expected returns

  Background:
    Given the user is on the Groww SIP calculator page on https://groww.in/calculators/sip-calculator

  Scenario: Calculate future values with valid inputs
    When the user enters "5000" into the "Monthly investment" field
    And the user enters "10" into the "Time period" field
    And the user enters "12" into the "Expected return rate (p.a)" field
    Then the future values such as Investment amount, Est. returns, and Total value of the investment are displayed
